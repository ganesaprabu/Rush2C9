### January 23, 2026 (Day 3) — MAJOR DESIGN REVISION

**Session 1: Design Discussion**
- [x] Reviewed v3.0 status — identified "form filling" problem
- [x] Discussed Phaser.js racing approach
- [x] Reviewed Phaser Driving example (https://moonsault.itch.io/phaser-driving)
- [x] Changed terrain types → road types (more intuitive)
- [x] Updated vehicles (removed water/air, added road vehicles)
- [x] Finalized on-screen controls (arrow buttons + boost)

**Session 2: Flow Simplification** ⭐ KEY DECISIONS
- [x] **MAJOR CHANGE:** Reduced screens before racing from 5+ to 1 tap!
- [x] **MAJOR CHANGE:** Vehicle selection moved to Pit Stops (mid-game)
- [x] **MAJOR CHANGE:** Map view moved to END (victory screen, not setup)
- [x] **MAJOR CHANGE:** Route difficulty auto-assigned (no player selection)

**What Changed:**
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Home → Destination → City → Route Select → Vehicle Select → Racing | Home → Tap Destination → City (3s) → Racing |
| 5+ screens to start | 1 tap to start |
| Pre-select vehicle | Default Car, switch at Pit Stops |
| Map before racing | Journey Map at END (victory!) |
| Player picks route difficulty | Auto-assigned (moderate) |

**Rationale:**
- Booth environment = short attention spans
- Every extra screen = friction = players walk away
- Vehicle selection is strategic, but upfront it's confusing
- Map at end is a REWARD, not a setup chore

**Session 3: Documentation & Code**
- [x] Updated GAME_MECHANICS.md with simplified flow
- [x] Added Pit Stop system design
- [x] Added Journey Map (end screen) design
- [x] Updated game duration target: ~2 minutes
- [x] Updated gameData.js with:
  - New vehicles (Bike, Car, Tractor, Truck, Sports Car)
  - Road types (Highway, Tar, Mud, Bumpy)
  - Vehicle-road speed matrix
  - Route difficulties
  - Phaser config constants
  - Obstacle definitions
  - Helper functions
- [x] Updated GameScreen.jsx placeholder with new data
- [x] Updated PLANNING.md with revised phases
- [x] Updated PROGRESS.md (this file)

**Next Session:**
- Start Phase 3.2: City Reveal Screen (Auto-Advance)
- Implement 3-second countdown to racing

---

### January 24, 2026 (Day 4) — Mobile & Steering Improvements

**Completed:**
- [x] Attempted tilt-to-steer controls for mobile (reverted - didn't work on Android)
- [x] Fixed mobile viewport black space issue (100dvh + viewport-fit=cover)
- [x] Increased steering range from ±1.0 to ±3.0 (car can move much further left/right)
- [x] Increased steering speed to 8.0 (from original 1.8)
- [x] Fixed road overlap issue when steering wide (car moves visually instead of road shifting)
- [x] Moved player car position higher (140px from bottom instead of 50px) to avoid overlapping control buttons
- [x] Unified control buttons UI for both mobile and desktop (consistent experience)
- [x] Implemented native event listeners for touch handling (attempt to improve mobile responsiveness)
- [x] Removed unused deviceDetect.js utility file

**Code Changes (Uncommitted):**
- `ControlButtons.jsx` - Native event listeners, unified UI for mobile/desktop
- `RacingScene.js` - Steering speed 8.0, player car Y position -140px
- `GameScreen.jsx` - Restructured layout with absolute positioning for HUD and controls

**Known Issues (Pending):**
- ⚠️ **Mobile Touch Responsiveness** - Tap on steering buttons requires long press on mobile; quick taps don't register reliably. Multiple approaches tried (React events, native events, pointer events). Needs further investigation.

**Technical Notes:**
- Steering range: -3.0 to 3.0 (playerX)
- Steering speed multiplier: 8.0
- Road shift reduced to 0.02/0.01 (was 0.25/0.12) to prevent road edges overlapping car
- Car visual offset: `steerOffset = playerX * (width * 0.12)`
- Player car Y: `height - 140` (above control buttons)

---

### January 24, 2026 (Day 4 - Session 2) — HUD Redesign & Speed Configuration

**Completed:**
- [x] Redesigned HUD to single compact row: `[Seg 1/4 | 💳 200 | ⏱️ 56s | 🚗 100 | 📍 0.5km | ▓▓░░░░]`
- [x] Added speed display (dynamic, updates every 200ms to avoid flicker)
- [x] Added distance traveled display
- [x] Made HUD bar taller (2x height) for better readability
- [x] Throttled stats updates to 200ms interval (was every frame)
- [x] Documented speed & segment configuration in GAME_MECHANICS.md

**Configuration Decisions (Highly Configurable):**

| Config | Value | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Segment distances | [5, 7, 9] km | Progressive difficulty |
| Segment start speeds | [100, 125, 160] km/h | Speed carries over |
| Speed increase | +5 km/h per 1 km | Gradual acceleration |
| Max speed | 200 km/h | Cap to prevent runaway |
| Boost amount | +25 km/h | Temporary speed burst |
| Boost duration | 3 seconds | Then returns to base |
| Boost cooldown | 10 seconds | System-controlled availability |
| Collision slowdown | 50% speed | Punishment for hitting obstacles |
| Slowdown duration | 2 seconds | Recovery time |

**Code Changes (Uncommitted):**
- `GameHUD.jsx` - Single row compact layout with all stats
- `RacingScene.js` - Stats throttling (200ms), segmentDistanceKm
- `GameScreen.jsx` - Speed/distance state, handleStats callback
- `PhaserGame.jsx` - onStats callback passthrough
- `GAME_MECHANICS.md` - New "Segment & Speed Configuration" section

**Next:**
- Implement the speed configuration in gameData.js
- Apply segment distances and speed progression in RacingScene
- Implement boost cooldown system (system-driven, not credit-based)

## Important Context (For New Sessions)

### What is Cloud9?
- Cloud9 is a professional **esports organization** (like IPL teams for cricket)
- They own teams that compete in video game tournaments
- Main games: League of Legends (LCS league) and VALORANT (VCT league)
- Headquarters: Santa Monica, California
- Website: https://cloud9.gg

### What is this Hackathon?
- **Name:** "Sky's the Limit" — Cloud9 x JetBrains Hackathon
- **Category 4:** Event Game — Mini-game for fan booths at LCS/VCT events
- **Prize:** Winner's game gets integrated into real Cloud9 booth!
- **Deadline:** February 3, 2026 @ 11:00 AM PT

### Our Game Concept
Rush2C9 — Fans race from random cities worldwide to reach Cloud9's arenas (LCS or VCT). They choose routes and vehicles, balancing speed vs cost. Creates competition via leaderboard and head-to-head duels with score betting.

### Key Design Principles (Updated Jan 23)
1. **1 tap to start** — Minimal screens before racing
2. **Default vehicle** — Start with Car, switch at Pit Stops
3. **Journey Map at END** — Victory celebration, not setup
4. **Auto route difficulty** — System handles, player races
5. **~2 minute games** — Perfect for booth environment
